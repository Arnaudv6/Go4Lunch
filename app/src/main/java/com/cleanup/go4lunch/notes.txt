Todo Nino : est-ce qu'il faut plus de log
    un catcher de stacktrace
    et loguer dans un fichier applicatif?

Notes:
  - my usage of nominatim is borderline. search-autocompletion is unacceptable use
  - distances are calculated by GPS coordinates, not taking routes into account
  - restaurants images are not linked to actual restaurants they're attached to
  - map scale is erratic non-sense

todo
    validate a lunch when user is in 20m range from announced restaurant between 11h30 and 14h?
    then remove place from goingAtNoon
    snackBar if user clicks "goingAtNoon" between 14h30 and 24h?

push notifications:
    the tricky part really is client-side:
        a battery-efficient, network-efficient, C++/XMPP, architecture-tight-bound always up service.
    maintaining that connection open only to faint a server-to-client initiative.
        Godot / Cordova... every one relies on google play services.
        only alternative I found short of writing a C++ service myself is paho (see alternatives below)

    Go4Lunch actual requirement is a daily message at noon.
        Fixed time -> we don't care if server or client initiates the check request.

    Alarm instead of a push-notification is only about the trigger.
    All other constraints are independent follow-ups:
        single-user multi-device
        protocol for request itself (server API)
